## Development (Running locally)

- Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bolah2009/udacity-travel-app
```

- Install Dependencies

  ```bash
  yarn install
  ```

- Setting up environment variables

- Copy `.env.example` file to `.env`

  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

- Edit the variables to approprate values. You can sign up to the following accounts get free API Keys:

  1.  [Geonames](http://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html) for `API_USER_NAME`
  2.  [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/account/create) for `WEATHERBIT_API_KEY`
  3.  [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) for `PIXABAY_API_KEY`

- Build files with `webpack`:

  To build files with production configure, run

  ```bash
  yarn build
  ```

  To build files with dev config and watch file changes, run

  ```bash
  yarn build:dev
  ```

  To start `node` server, you can run

  ```bash
  yarn start
  ```

  Depending of what `PORT` is set as in the `.env` file, the app can be aceesed on localhost
  e.g. for PORT=5000 go to http://localhost:5000/

To run StyleLint and ESLint by itself, you may run the lint task:

```bash
yarn lint:check
```

Or to automatically fix issues found (where possible):

```bash
yarn lint
```

You can also check against Prettier:

```bash
yarn format:check
```

and to have it actually fix (to the best of its ability) any format issues, run:

```bash
yarn format
```

You can also check against HTML Validator:

```bash
yarn html-validator
```
